# Linear Regression Case Study

## Project Overview

This repository contains a case study demonstrating the application of linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. The study aims to understand and model the relationship between two variables using a simple linear regression approach.

## Description

### Data Loading and Preparation
The dataset is loaded and prepared for analysis. This step involves cleaning the data and ensuring it is in the appropriate format for linear regression.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial analysis is conducted to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data. This includes visualizing the data to identify patterns and relationships.

### Model Building
A simple linear regression model is constructed using the prepared data. The model aims to capture the relationship between the independent variable (predictor) and the dependent variable (response).

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using appropriate metrics. This step ensures that the model accurately represents the data and can make reliable predictions.

### Visualization
The results of the linear regression analysis are visualized to provide a clear understanding of the relationship between the variables. This includes plotting the regression line and the data points.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this case study, you will learn:
- How to apply linear regression to real-world data.
- The steps involved in preparing and analyzing data for linear regression.
- How to interpret the results of a linear regression model.
- The importance of visualizing data and model outcomes.
